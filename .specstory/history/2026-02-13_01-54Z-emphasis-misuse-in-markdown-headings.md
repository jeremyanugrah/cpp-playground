# Emphasis Misuse in Markdown Headings (2026-02-13 01:54Z)

@workspace /explain MD036/no-emphasis-as-heading: Emphasis used instead of a heading

---

_**Agent (model copilot/claude-opus-4.6)**_

The markdownlint warning **MD036** flags the line:

```
**Apply**: Back up your old config, then save this to `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`.
```

The linter thinks `**Apply**` at the start of a line is being used as a makeshift heading instead of proper Markdown heading syntax.

### Fix

Either convert it to a proper heading:

````markdown
// ...existing code...

#### Apply

Back up your old config, then save this to `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`.
On first launch, lazy.nvim will auto-install all plugins. Run `:checkhealth` to verify.
````

Or, if you intentionally want inline bold (not a heading), rephrase so the bold text isn't the only emphasis on the line — which suppresses the rule:

````markdown
// ...existing code...

**Apply:** Back up your old config, then save this to `~/.config/nvim/init.lua`.
On first launch, lazy.nvim will auto-install all plugins. Run `:checkhealth` to verify.
````

> **Why the difference?** MD036 triggers when a paragraph consists *solely* of emphasized text (it looks like a heading). Adding the colon inside the bold (`**Apply:**`) makes the rest of the paragraph part of the same inline content, but technically the rule checks if the *entire paragraph* is just emphasis. Since here `**Apply**:` is followed by more text on the same line, the real trigger is the pattern matching — the simplest clean fix is option 1 (use a real heading).

**Recommended:** Go with the `#### Apply` heading if this is truly a section label. It's semantically correct and accessible.
