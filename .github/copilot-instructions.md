*   Avoid using emphasis (e.g., bold text) as a substitute for proper Markdown headings. If a section label is needed, use the `#### Heading` format instead. This improves semantic correctness and accessibility. Specifically, be aware of markdownlint warning **MD036** which flags instances where a line consists solely of emphasized text.
